# Fridge Contents Analyzer

## Description
This project allows its users to easily identify what dishes they can make while using the ingredients available to them. The user can simply upload a picture of the ingredients currently accessible to them, and then the program returns recipes for potential dishes that the user can make. 

## Container Images
[MongoDB Container](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo)

## Configuration/Setup Instructions
To successfully setup the program, first clone the repository locally. Make sure you already have mongodb running locally on your machine, or adjust the MONGO_URI in the docker compose file to point to it. Then simply go into the database folder and run the command 
'''
docker-compose up --build
'''
Then you can navigate to http://localhost:5000/ to see the program running.
